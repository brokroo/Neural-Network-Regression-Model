# Developing a Neural Network Regression Model

## AIM

To develop a Neural Network–based regression model for predicting the spending score of customers using the given dataset.

## THEORY
```
Problem Statement Explanation:

An automobile company wants to understand customer behavior based on demographic features such as Age.
The Spending Score represents how actively a customer spends money. Predicting this score helps the company:
-Analyze customer purchasing behavior
-Design personalized offers
-Improve marketing strategies
Since the output (Spending Score) is a continuous numerical value, the problem is treated as a regression problem.
A Neural Network Regression Model is used to learn the relationship between age and spending score.

## DESIGN STEPS

### STEP 1: Loading the Dataset
The customer dataset is loaded using the Pandas library.

### STEP 2: Splitting the Dataset
The dataset is split into training data and testing data to evaluate model performance.

### STEP 3: Data Scaling
MinMaxScaler is used to normalize the input values between 0 and 1.

### STEP 4: Building the Neural Network Model
A feedforward neural network is created using PyTorch with linear layers and ReLU activation.

### STEP 5: Training the Model
The model is trained using Mean Squared Error loss and RMSprop optimizer.

### STEP 6: Plotting the Performance
Training loss is plotted against epochs to visualize learning behavior.

### STEP 7: Model Evaluation
The trained model is evaluated using test data and test loss is calculated.
